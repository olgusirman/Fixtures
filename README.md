A developer at your company has been working on a fixtures app for Hull City Tigers. The app uses the football-data.org API to fetch matches and display them to the user.

You've inherited their unfinished project, and a design mockup (attached). It looks like the project might have some bugs, and the user interface definitely needs some work.

Your job is to add the missing features below, refactoring and fixing any bugs you might come across and prioritising as you see fit. Feel free to re-work any aspect of the codebase you’re not happy with, within the bounds of the original spec.

Requirements: 

Architecture:
- Structure should be migrated to MVVM
- Seperate the different layers (service, model, business logic, views)
- Write unit tests
- Use git for version control, committing early and often

The app should show:
- List the matches in a chronological order with results shown first
- Display scores for previous matches and a countdown to the next match
- Display the date, competition and venue of each match

You should spend no more than 4-5 hours on the project - we know this isn’t anywhere near enough time to complete the spec, so no pressure to build all the features or fix all the bugs! We’re interested to see how far you get in that time and the decisions you make along the way. Please update the README below, briefly explaining:
- What were your priorities, and why?
- If you had more time, what would you have tackled next? - what would you change about the structure of the code?
- What bugs did you find but not fix?
- What would you change about the visual design of the app?

We know it’s tough to find a spare few hours, so there's no hard deadline - if you're busy or travelling right now and won’t find time in the next week or so, please let us know so we don’t check-in with you too early!
